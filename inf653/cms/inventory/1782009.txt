Most are 3' triangles some are 2' triangles.
 All are 20' sections. Some are bent up from falling, most are in good shape.
They make very good pipe or iron racks they could be used for buisness band radios getting you satilite dish above tree line, barn trusses bridges for ATVs or many other uses.
most of them are the 3' ones solid bar construction galvanized steel = heavy.
I can load and possibly deliver.
I am thinking $100.00 for the bent ones and on up to $400.00 for the really nice ones per section. Making deals on multiple pieces.
I have all the guy wire and turnbuckles, bolts and hardware too.";}
